This application needs a TinyOS and ContikiOS environment installed to run.

Web2Compile was developed using the TinyOS 2.1.2 and ContikiOS 2.7.

You can download both from the links below and copy to the web2compile root folder.

TinyOS 2.1.2: https://github.com/tinyos/tinyos-release
ContikiOS 2.7: http://www.contiki-os.org/download.html


Please, change the folder "tinyos_dir" to an application of TinyOS (Example: Blink) in the files:

webserver.py at line 17
statis/JS/globals/js at line 13

Enjoy :)
